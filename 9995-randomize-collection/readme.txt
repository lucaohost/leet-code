## Problem: Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed

Difficulty: Hard

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item val to the collection.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item val from the collection if present.
3. `getRandom()`: Returns a random element from current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same value the collection contains.

### Note:

1. You may assume the input is valid, i.e., no inserts will be called on an empty collection and no removes will be called on a non-existing element.
2. Elements can be repeated.
